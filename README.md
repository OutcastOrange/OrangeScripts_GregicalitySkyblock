# OrangeScripts - Gregicality Skyblock #

These scripts are intended to be used with the modpack Gregicality Skyblock Edition.
I'll be modifying and tweaking them as I play through the pack, but this text upload might not be updated.
This is just a snapshot of my scripts as of August 8th, 2021.

I made these scripts with minimal understanding. These scripts are highly amateur.
There are probably some redundant lines.
A lot of these imports are probably not doing anything.
Suggestions for improvements are welcome.

# Instructions #

Download these files and add them to the scripts directory: 
"...\Instances\Gregicality Skyblock Edition\scripts"

These script files can be used independently (per mod), but most require "orange - Additions" to function.

If you intend to use AutomatedRedstone, make sure you get these exact mod versions:
  "CD4017BE Library"    CD4017BE_lib-1.12.2-6.4.18.jar
  "Automated Redstone"  AutomatedRedstone-1.12.2-6.1.6.jar
